Lesson

Make a website for a store.

As a store owner, I want to create a new entry for a product with a name, price, and description.

As a shopper, I want to see a list of all the products in the store, and be able to click on them to get more information.

As a store owner, I want to make sure only I and other store employees can add, edit, and remove products. Hint: Add user authentication. Instead of letting people sign up for the site, "seed" the site with one login you create from the Rails console. Allow that user to CRUD/L additional users. Only allow unauthenticated users to list and show products; all other actions for products and all actions for users should be restricted to authenticated users.
